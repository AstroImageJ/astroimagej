/**
 * (<i>for internal use</i>) BZIP2 (<code>.bz2</code>) input stream decompression with a preference for using an
 * external system command. You can use this class to decompress files that have been compressed with the UNIX
 * <b>bzip2</b> tool and have the characteristic <code>.bz2</code> file name extension. It effectively provides the same
 * functionality as {@link BZip2CompressionProvider}, but has a preference for calling on the system <b>bzip2</b>
 * command first to do the lifting. If that fails it will call on {@link CompressionManager} to provide a suitable
 * decompressor (which will give it {@link BZip2CompressionProvider}). Since the <b>bzip2</b> tool is UNIX-specific, it
 * is not entirely portable. It also requires the environment variable <code>BZIP_DECOMPRESSOR</code> to be set to
 * provide the system executable to use. As a result, you are probably better off relying on the mentioned other classes
 * directly for this functionality.
 * 
 * @see        CompressionManager
 * 
 * @deprecated Use {@link ZCompressionProvider}, or the more generic {@link CompressionManager} with a preference toward
 *                 using the system command if possible, instead.
