/**
 * <p>

 * runtime exceptions only. Regular header access throws
 * {@link HeaderCardException}s, which are hard exceptions. They really should
 * have been softer runtime exceptions from the start, but unfortunately that
 * was choice this library made a very long time ago, and we therefore stick to
 * it, at least until the next major code revision (major version 2 at the
 * earliest). So this class provides an alternative access to headers converting
 * any <code>HeaderCardException</code>s to {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is really just a rusty rail implementation, and rather incopmlete at it
 * too. It has very limited support for header access, geared very specifically
 * towards supporting the compression classes of this library, and not mean for
 * use beyond.
