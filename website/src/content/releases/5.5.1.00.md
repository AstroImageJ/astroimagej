### Includes
ImageJ 1.54m1 and Java 24


## New Features
- `Multi-Aperture > File > ‘Save data subset to file’` now supports outputting full JD-related data in all data columns. Previously, outputting any time-related column (containing JD in the label), other than in the first (leftmost) column would subtract the integer value for purposes of detrending and avoiding fitting the large JD numbers. To now output the fractional version of the JD number, select the version of the time column label in the dropdown mention that is prefixed with ‘F’ (for fractional). For example, to output the decimal part of BJD_UTC, select FBJD_UTC in the dropdown menu.
- `Multi-Aperture > File > ‘Save data subset to file’` now allows the user to define custom constant column values and column label names for output in the data subset file. For example, to output a column labelled ‘Target’ with the value ‘Sirius’, open ‘Save data subset to file’, select the ‘Constant Col’ button at the bottom and define the label, value pairs that you desire to output. Click Okay to return to the Save Data Subset main panel. Then select the desired label names in the dropdown menus in the order that you want them in the output file.
## Bug Fixes
